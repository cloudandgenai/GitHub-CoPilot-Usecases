# 🚀 "GitHub Copilot in Action: Code, Refactor & Automate Like a Pro!

[Start with the overview](../Overview.md) - Please make sure to read the Overview.md file first to understand the prerequisites and important notes before executing the prompts below.

### Code Generation:
- `Create a Java class named Customer to validate name, date of birth (dob), and address.`

- `Create a C# method to sort a list of country names.`

- `Create a login page which accepts user name and password (let say user name is admin and password is admin@123) with UI validation in react.js`

### Code Refactoring:
- `Refactor the Customer class to follow the Dependency Injection (DI) principle, naming the interface as ICustomer.`

- `Generate a React.js component for a student profile page with fields for name, dob, and mobile number.`
  - `Refactor the student profile component to include a date picker control for the dob field.`
  - `Refactor the student profile component to use date picker styles from the Material-UI library.`
  - `Refactor the student profile component to support responsive web design.`

### UT Scripts Generation:
- `Create an asp.net security controller to validate the User login credentials and throw error when values are null in C#`-> #right click -> generate unit tests

- `Create a python method addressvalidation to validate user address.`
  - `Generate unit test scripts for the #addressvalidation` 
  - `How to run this tests` -> #take copilot help to run and see outcome

### ⚠️Important Note:
- AI-generated code is not always 100% correct – review, validate, and refine it..
- Your prompt clarity determines the quality of Copilot's response.
- Use iterative refinement – start broad, then refine your prompt for better results.
